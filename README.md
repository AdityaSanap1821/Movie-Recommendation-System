# Movie-Recommendation-System

Problem Statement:
We have developed an AI Model to recommend Movies based on the user’s favorite movie. 
We have built this model on Python and its libraries.

System Architecture:
The Python Libraries used to build this model are:

•	Numpy: To perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays

•	Pandas: To analyse dataset.

•	Difflib: To take input from the user. 

•	Sklearn: converts text to numericals so we can apply cosine similarity 

Note: This Model can be upgraded to be used for applications like Netflix, Amazon, and other OTT platforms where the dataset is continuously updated.
